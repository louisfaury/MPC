• The script *ex2_template.m* implements the Barrier Penalization method for a given mu, and with **slow** settings to be able to visualize convergence. 
• The script *ex2.m* runs the same procedure but for different values of mu, before plotting the number of iterations (inner loop, descent direction computation) and the time required for every value of mu.
