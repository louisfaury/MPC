	\section{Introduction}
	{
		\paragraph{} This project aims at controlling the temperature inside a 3 room building. The full state and output dynamics are given by : 
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{aligned}
				x^+ &= Ax + B_uu + B_dd\\
				y &= Cx
			\end{aligned}
		\end{equation}
		where : 
		\begin{equation}
		\left\{
			\begin{aligned}
				&x \in \mathbb{R}^{10} & &\text{ has no significant physical meaning} \\
				&u \in\mathbb{R}^3 & &\text{ is the electrical power dedicated to the heating of each room}\\
				&d \in\mathbb{R}^3 & &\text{ is the disturbance input (temperature, solar gain and internal gains)} \\
				&y\in\mathbb{R}^3 & & \text{ is the temperature in each room of the building}
			\end{aligned}\right.
		\end{equation}
		
		\paragraph{} The disturbance will be considered as an input, since we have its prediction over a period of 8 days. Figure (\ref{fig::temp_pred}) and (\ref{fig::gain_pred}) provide a plot of those predictive value. We can namely notice that we observe a \emph{\textcolor{red}{circadian periodicity}} (periodicity of 24h for the different signals).

		\paragraph{} The following sections implements different versions of model predictive controllers, considering different objectives : target tracking, cost minimization, storage cost, .. 
	}
	
	\section{First MPC Controller}
	{
		\paragraph{} In this section, we are using YALMIP in order to design a MPC controller. This controller must regulate the output of the system around the reference output : 
		\begin{equation}
			y_r = \begin{pmatrix} 24 & 24 & 24 \end{pmatrix}
		\end{equation}
		by optimizing the cost function : 
		\begin{equation}
			J = \sum_{n=1}^N (y_n-y_r)^T R (y-y_n)
		\end{equation}
		under the following constraints : 
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{aligned}
				& y_n \geq 22, \quad & &n\in\{1,\hdots,N\} \\
				& y_n \leq 26, \quad & &n\in\{1,\hdots,N\} \\
				& u_n \leq 15, \quad & &n\in\{1,\hdots,N\} \\												& u_n \geq 0, \quad & &n\in\{1,\hdots,N\} \\
			\end{aligned}
		\end{equation}
		In the following, $R$ is chosen to be $\mathds{1}_3$ (hence we are penalizing equally any fluctuations around the target value, independently of the room). Given a cost function, multiplying $R$ by a scalar value won't have any effect on the optimal solution. 
		\newline We decided \emph{not to implement} a terminal cost nor terminal set constraints. This was mainly motivated by the fact that even with small horizons $N$, the system is \emph{experimentally} stable and recursively feasible. Hence, given the fact that the control invariant set could be computationally challenging to compute, and because its use would reduce the attraction zone in our state space, there was no real need to use terminal cost or terminal set. Moreover, the system is \emph{extremely reactive}, therefore we are able to reach, even with small horizons,  a cost that approximates the infinite horizon cost. 
		
		\paragraph{} Figures (\ref{fig::naivempc_N5_output}) and (\ref{fig::naivempc_N5_inputs}) respectively show the dynamics of the outputs and inputs of the systems control this MPC controller, given a horizon $N=5$, along their respective constraints and reference. 
		
		\begin{figure}[ht!]
			\begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
				\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{naivempc_N5_output}
				\caption{Output regulation, $N=5$}
				\label{fig::naivempc_N5_output}
			\end{minipage}
			\hfill
			\begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
				\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{naivempc_N5_inputs}
				\caption{Inputs, $N=5$}
				\label{fig::naivempc_N5_inputs}
			\end{minipage}
		\end{figure}
		We can already note that all constraints are indeed verified. Because the disturbance is perfectly forecast (the disturbance applied is exactly the predicted one), the output tracking is done almost perfectly. We can indeed note that the temperature of the second room sometimes shows an overshoot. Because it is probably south-orientated, it is warmed up by the sun, which causes the room's temperature to rise, even if the input is zero. We can wonder what happens if we increase the prediction horizon so that the controller would be able to consider this raise in temperature. Figure (\ref{fig::naivempc_N20_output}) shows the rooms temperature for a controller of receeding horizon $N=20$. 
		\begin{figure}[ht!]
			\begin{center}
				\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{naivempc_N20_output}
				\caption{Output regulation, $N=20$}
				\label{fig::naivempc_N20_output}
			\end{center}
		\end{figure}
		
		\paragraph{} Because the controller is now able to consider the temperature raise due to the orientation of the room and the sun exposition, it allows a small undershoot by setting the corresponding input to 0 well before this event. Therefore, a smaller undershoot is achieved when increasing the horizon. 
	}
   
   	\section{Economic MPC}
	{
		\paragraph{} We now wish to formulate our objective function as an economic function : given the electricity's price, we would like to minimize our bill. 
		\paragraph{} This implies switching to a linear cost function : 
		\begin{equation}
			J = C^T\left(\sum_{n=1}^N u_n\right)
		\end{equation}
		where $C=\begin{pmatrix} c & c & c\end{pmatrix}^T$ is a cost matrix, with $c=0.2$ \$/kWh. However, because this linear cost function might break some stability and recursive feasibility properties, a soft constraint formulation should be preferred. 
	}
	
	\section{Soft Constraints}
	{
	
		\begin{figure}[ht!]
			\begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
				\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{soft_constraints_01}
				\caption{Cost minimization with soft-constraints, $r_\eps=0.1$}
				\label{fig::soft_constraints_01}
			\end{minipage}
			\hfill
			\begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
				\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{soft_constraints_10}
				\caption{Cost minimization with soft-constraints, $r_\eps=10$}
				\label{fig::soft_constraints_10}
			\end{minipage}
		\end{figure}
		
		\paragraph{} We hereinafter describe the soft constraints implementation of our controller and the obtained results. We decided to implement $L_2$ penalization for the slack variables, in order to limit constraints violation amplitude (a linear penalization would have penalized constraints violation duration instead). The actual optimization program we therefore solve writes : 
		\begin{mini}|s|[2]
  			{}{\sum_{n=1}^N\left[C^Tu_n +  r_\eps(\lVert \eps_n\rVert_2 +\lVert\hat{ \eps}_n\rVert_2)\right]}
  				 {\label{eq::svr}}{}
				 \addConstraint{y_n \geq 22 - \hat{\eps}_n}{\quad & &n\in\{1,\hdots,N\}}
				 \addConstraint{y_n \leq 26+\eps_n}{\quad & &n\in\{1,\hdots,N\}}
				 \addConstraint{u_n \leq 15}{\quad & &n\in\{1,\hdots,N\}}
				 \addConstraint{u_n \geq 0}{\quad & &n\in\{1,\hdots,N\}}
				 \addConstraint{\eps_n\geq 0}{\quad & &n\in\{1,\hdots,N\}}
				 \addConstraint{\hat{\eps}_n\geq 0}{\quad & &n\in\{1,\hdots,N\}}				 
		\end{mini}
		
		\paragraph{} Figures (\ref{fig::soft_constraints_01}) and (\ref{fig::soft_constraints_10}) display the results obtained with this controller, given an horizon size $N=20$, with two different penalization coefficient $r_\eps$. 
		\newline As one can expect, the retained solution's output stays near its lower bound, since this one corresponds to a lower cost. Also, by increasing the amplitude of the slack constraint amplitude, we reduce the size of the offset allowed by the tradeoff between constraints violation and cost minimization. 
		
	}
	
	\section{Variable Cost}
	{
		\paragraph{} We now wish to optimize a rather more realistic cost function, taking into account the variation of electricity prices. We consider the following model for the electricity prices : 
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{aligned}
				&c_k &= 0.2\$/kWh & &\quad \text{(between 12pm to 10am, and 4pm to 12pm)}\\
				&c_k &= 0.04\$/kWh & &\quad \text{(between 10:00Hrs to 16:00Hrs)}
			\end{aligned}
		\end{equation}
		This is achieved by specifying $c$ as a decision variable, provided at computation time. 
		
		\paragraph{} In the following, we consider $r_\eps = 1$ as well as $N = 20$. Figure (\ref{fig::var_cost_output}) displays the evolution of temperature given this control strategy. We can namely see that, starting a few hours before the days rises, the temperature in the office increases before dropping. Figure (\ref{fig::var_cost_inputs}) gives a better insight at what is going on in the controller (for room 1). Indeed, we see that at the end of the night, the controller is provided with the prediction that the cost is soon to go up. To enable the constraints to be (softly) satisfied, without having to pay for expensive electricity in the morning, it peaks the input to warm up the different rooms. Therefore, during the day, it only has to buy a small amount of power to keep the temperature near its feasible region.
